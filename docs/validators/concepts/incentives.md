# Block Rewards

To encourage active participation in the voting process, Treasurenet provides rewards for nodes involved in consensus, including delegators, active validators, and proposers.

Treasurenet will select a Proposer from the list of validators based on certain rules, who will be responsible for creating blocks. After a block is successfully created, the block reward (Unit Token) is distributed to the accounts of all participants in the consensus.

The consensus reward consists of the block issuance reward and the total transaction fees for each block. We allocate the consensus reward into different portions: community governance, block proposer reward, additional reward for validator, and PoS reward.
