# Becoming a Validator

Validator nodes, which store copies of blockchain history and validate new transactions, serve as the backbone of the blockchain. They generate revenue irrespective of the cryptocurrency market's direction. To operate a validator node, one must have a server with hardware and software configurations meeting the basic requirements. Download, install, and run the necessary software from GitHub to become a node within the Treasurenet blockchain network. An initial stake enables you to become a validator. We encourage all interested individuals or organizations to join us.

## What does it mean to be a validator?

Anyone holding a Unit token can operate a node to approve transactions within the network and receive rewards in the form of Units. Validators run the Treasurenet chain and maintain a copy of the blockchain (configuration and data directory) to verify transactions on the block network. Every 5 seconds, the block network broadcasts the latest transactions to the system, while validators validate and sign these transactions to ensure their immutability. Validators receive additional block rewards for their efforts.

By contributing their computing resources, validators help maintain the network and participate in network governance through voting. Validators serve as the network's maintainers and are responsible for its upkeep. They also play a crucial role in guiding the blockchain via governance mechanisms that necessitate Unit token holders to vote on essential decisions and network upgrades.

## Hardware Requirements

Validators should have redundant power, connectivity, and storage backup at their data center locations. They should have multiple redundant network boxes for fiber, firewalls, and switching, along with smaller servers featuring redundant hard drives and failover. Initially, hardware will likely be on the lower end of the data center equipment spectrum.

In the beginning, network requirements are expected to be minimal. As the network expands, bandwidth, CPU, and memory demands will grow. It is advisable to use large hard drives to store years of blockchain history.

## Supported OS

Treasurenet theoretically supports all Unix-based operating systems, macOS, and Microsoft Windows. However, as a young platform, it hasn't been extensively tested on all operating systems. Currently, it is confirmed to work seamlessly on Linux/x86_64.

## Minimum Requirements

To run a main or test network validator node, you will need a machine with the following minimum hardware requirements:

- 4 or more physical CPU cores
- At least 500GB of SSD disk storage
- At least 16GB of memory (RAM)
- At least 100mbps of network bandwidth.

With the growth of blockchain usage, server demands are expected to rise; thus, planning for server upgrades is important to accommodate future needs.

## How to become a validator?

- Each node must stake a minimum of 158 Unit tokens in the Treasurenet blockchain network, where all validators are required to meet staking requirements.
- To participate, run a full node.

## Software

For instructions on installing, deploying, and starting the node, we offer an open-source GitHub project with comprehensive documentation. (For more information, please refer to the Quick Guide document provided.)
