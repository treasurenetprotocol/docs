# How it works (Producer Flow)

1. **Producer submits real-world output**  
    Data is reported through the **TN Gateway** using hardware sensors, logs, or API integrations.

2. **Protocol sources live market pricing**  
    Oracle feeds deliver real-time price benchmarks to contextualize the submitted output.

3. **Asset-specific modules verify the data**  
    Each asset typeâ€”like oil, gas, or computeâ€”runs through its own rule-based verification engine.

4. **If verified â†’ REP Score is minted**  
    The producer earns an on-chain reputation tied directly to their proven contribution.

âœ… This process is **modular**, **private by design**, and **fully decentralized**.
