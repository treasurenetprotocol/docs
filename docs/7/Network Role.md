# Network Role

We introduced the core participants in Treasurenet’s architecture at the beginning—Producers, Validators, and Delegators. Now, let’s explore what each of them does in more detail, and how their actions uphold the value, security, and governance of the network.

### **1\. Producers: Core Participants**

**Producers** are the starting point of Treasurenet’s economy. They generate real-world value—like energy, compute, or raw materials—that becomes the foundation for token issuance and economic activity on-chain.

By contributing verifiable output, Producers ensure that Treasurenet’s value system is anchored in actual productivity.

**Bridging Two Worlds**

Treasurenet connects:

* **The Physical Economy** — what people actually produce  
* **The On-Chain Economy** — where incentives, credit, and governance flow.

Producers are the link between these layers.

**What Qualifies as a Producer?**

To qualify, your asset must meet two conditions:

| Requirement  | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| Measureable  | Captured by hardware sensors or software logs |
| Market-priced | Has a public market price (oracle compatible) |

**If yes → you’re eligible to earn REP and participate in Treasurenet’s token economy.**

**Examples:**

* Oil refineries logging daily barrel counts  
* Bitcoin miners submitting proof-of-work  
* Solar farms measuring kilowatt-hours  
* Cloud services or API operators reporting usage  
* Data center hosts tracking bandwidth or uptime

Treasurenet launches with a select group of foundational producers—assets that are rare, measurable, and high-value—to anchor its on-chain economy in real-world and digital productivity.

**Physical Assets: Natural Gas & Oil**

Natural gas and oil are the first physical assets onboarded. These commodities are produced in enclosed, controlled environments and can be monitored consistently using on-site hardware. Their measurable output and established market pricing make them ideal candidates to define early currency issuance.

**Digital Assets: Bitcoin & Ethereum Classic**  

On the digital side, Bitcoin and Ethereum Classic represent proof-of-work-based rarity. Treasurenet integrates directly with these networks via the TN Gateway, allowing miners to verify their contribution and mint REP. This brings scarce digital production into the same framework as physical assets.
