## TCash Finance

### Exchange

#### Exchange (UNIT â†’ TCash)

Enter the amount of UNIT you wish to convert to TCash and click 'Submit'. The input number must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to the account balance and conversion limit, otherwise, it cannot be successfully submitted.

- Rule Explanation:

  1. Users provide UNIT to exchange for TCash, and the number of TCash that can be exchanged is calculated based on the number of UNITs, the price of UNIT, and the price of TCash;

  2. Determine whether the number of TCash that can be exchanged is greater than the market demand for TCash:

  - If it exceeds the market demand for TCash, the exchange fails;

  - If it's less than or equal to the market demand for TCash, TCash is minted and sent to the user's account.

  3. The number of TCash that can be exchanged (rounded down) = (Number of UNITs \* Price of UNIT) / Price of TCash;

  4. Market demand for TCash = max [total TCash minted by the system, 50,000,000];

  5. When the total number of TCash minted by the system is greater than or equal to 50,000,000, the TCash exchange entrance will be closed.

#### Repurchase (TCash â†’ UNIT)

Enter the number of UNITs you want to repurchase and click 'Submit'. The input number must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to the account balance, otherwise, it cannot be successfully submitted.

- Rule Explanation:

  1. Users provide TCash to repurchase UNITs, and the number of UNITs that can be repurchased is calculated based on the amount of TCash, the price of TCash, and the price of UNIT;

  2. Determine whether the number of UNITs repurchased by the user is greater than the system repurchase limit:

  - If it's less than or equal to the system repurchase limit, the TCash provided by the user is destroyed, and the repurchased UNIT is returned to the user;

  - If it exceeds the system repurchase limit, the UNIT repurchase fails, and the TCash provided by the user is returned.

  3. System repurchase limit for UNITs = (Total TCash of the system - Market demand for TCash) \* TCash price / UNIT price;

  4. The conditions for opening and closing the UNIT repurchase function are:

  - When the total TCash of the system > Market demand for TCash, open Unit repurchase;

  - When the total TCash of the system <= Market demand for TCash
