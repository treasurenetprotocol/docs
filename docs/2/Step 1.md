# Step 1: Real-World Output is Generated

It all begins with work—**real, measurable production**.

Who’s involved (examples include):

**Oil & gas operators** logging flow rates

* **Bitcoin miners** submitting hash proofs  
* **Solar farms** tracking kilowatt-hours  
* **API providers or digital infra** submitting bandwidth metrics

This work must be:

* Quantifiable (not subjective)  
* Time-bound (with clear windows)  
* Market-valued (with price benchmarks)

While Treasurenet’s initial focus is on energy—particularly oil and gas—our ambition goes far beyond. **We’re building toward a future where any form of verified real-world activity can plug into the network: from telecommunications and bandwidth markets to data monetization and digital commerce.**

Our goal is simple: to create a trusted network where real people can do real things—seamlessly, securely, and on-chain.
