The **TN Gateway** is Treasurenet’s decentralized API layer, designed to bridge real-world data sources with on-chain smart contracts. It enables the seamless flow of production data, staking activity, dApp interactions, and token movements.

**Core Functions:**

* **Aggregate:** Pulls data from trusted hardware (e.g., smart meters) and software (e.g., logs, APIs)  
* **Structure:** Formats raw data for standardized, transparent on-chain use  
* **Bridge:** Delivers clean, verified inputs to asset modules, validators, and contracts

**Built for Every Role:**

* **Producers:** Submit production data effortlessly through off-chain tools and smart meter integrations  
* **Developers:** Build with structured, queryable data exposed via robust APIs  
* **Auditors:** Conduct transparent cross-verification without compromising producer privacy

**Support Tools:**

* **Data Tools:** Off-chain utilities that assist with integration, data formatting, and pipeline setup  
* **Developer Access:** Provides endpoints for production records, REP histories, staking flows, and ecosystem activity—ready for indexing, dashboards, and research tooling

All activity is governed by Treasurenet’s privacy-first framework to ensure contributor confidentiality.
