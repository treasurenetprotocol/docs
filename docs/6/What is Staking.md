# What is Staking

Validator nodes are **independent participants** who maintain the Treasurenet blockchain by recording and verifying network activity—including real-world asset productivity.

To join the network, Validators must stake $UNIT tokens as collateral. This stake is subject to penalties (slashing) if the Validator behaves dishonestly or fails to meet protocol requirements.

### **Delegated Staking**

Any $UNIT holder can also participate by delegating their tokens to Validators—sharing in network rewards without needing to run a node themselves.

### **Why Staking Matters**

Staking ensures that:

* Validators have skin in the game  
* Network consensus remains decentralized  
* REP-generated $UNIT is secured by real economic participation
