# What is Bonus Stake

Bonus Stake is a system that gives users with strong on-chain reputation (REP) the ability to earn extra rewards.

* Along with staking $UNIT, users can "bid" their REP Score to boost validator rewards.  
* Any REP used in a bid gets burned—meaning it's permanently removed. This makes Bonus Stake a choice: trade some REP for the chance at higher yield.  
* The more REP you commit, the more likely you are to earn enhanced rewards. It’s a competitive way to link real productivity to staking outcomes.

**Why Bonus Stake Matters**

Most proof-of-stake systems reward capital alone. Treasurenet rewards **verified productivity.** Bonus Stake bridges this gap by:

* Incentivizing real-world work with yield  
* Creating productive competition among validators  
* Ensuring that those contributing the most verifiable value gain the most protocol influence

This creates a closed economic loop where:  
 Work → Reputation → Currency → Governance and Yield
