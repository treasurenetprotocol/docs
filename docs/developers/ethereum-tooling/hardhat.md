# Hardhat: Deploying a Smart Contract

[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is a versatile development environment specifically created for building smart contracts on the Ethereum network. It offers flexibility, allowing developers to easily integrate and extend its functionalities.

## Install Dependencies

:::info
Before proceeding, you need to install Node.js (we'll use v16.x) and the npm package manager.

## Create Hardhat Project

To create a new project, navigate to your project directory and run:

```shell
$ npx hardhat

888    888                      888 888               888
888    888                      888 888               888
888    888                      888 888               888

By following the prompts, you will be able to create a new project structure in your chosen directory. To configure your Hardhat project, you can refer to the Hardhat config page, which provides a list of configuration options that can be specified in the `hardhat.config.js` file. One crucial configuration is setting the `defaultNetwork` entry to point to your desired JSON-RPC network.

```shell
module.exports = {
  defaultNetwork: "testnet",
  networks: {
    hardhat: {
    },
    testnet: {
      url: "https://node1.testnet.treasurenet.io:8545",
      accounts: [privateKey1, privateKey2, ...]
    }
  }
}
```

To ensure you are targeting the correct network, you can query for a list of accounts available to you from your default network provider:

```shell
$ npx hardhat accounts
0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB88273c5d6ba293358
```

## Deploying a Smart Contract

A default smart contract, written in Solidity, has already been provided under `contracts/Greeter.sol`:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "hardhat/console.sol";

contract Greeter {
    string private greeting;

    constructor(string memory _greeting) {
        console.log("Deploying a Greeter with greeting:", _greeting);
        greeting = _greeting;
    }

    function greet() public view returns (string memory) {
        return greeting;
    }

    function setGreeting(string memory _greeting) public {
        console.log("Changing greeting from '%s' to '%s'", greeting, _greeting);
        greeting = _greeting;
    }
}

```

This contract allows you to set and query a string greeting.

Hardhat also provides a script to deploy smart contracts to a target network; this can be invoked via the following command, targeting your default network:

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

Hardhat also lets you manually specify a target network via the --network your-network flag:

```shell
npx hardhat run --network {{ $themeConfig.project.rpc_url_testnet }} scripts/deploy.js
```

Finally, try running a Hardhat test:

```shell
$ npx hardhat test
