# Producer Portal

Production Portal is an user interface that helps Producers onboard real-world assets and manage connected assets, in order to mint $TAT.

## What can you do in the Production Portal?

**1. Register as a Producer**

Different asset classes would require different registration workflows. Initial support offered to natural gas, oil, BTC, and ETH Classic Producers.

**2. Register a real-world asset**

Pilot real-world asset connections are natural gas and oil wells.

**3. Upload asset output**

Producers can report real-world production data directly to Treasurenet through the Producer Tools, and obtain the corresponding $TAT upon clearing the smart contract audit.

**4. Deposit $UNIT as collateral**

Producers need to deposit some $UNIT as collateral to discourage large deviations between reported production and audited production results.

**5. Mint TAT**

Pending above steps 1 to 4, asset data smart contracts will conduct a production audit; applicable $TAT will be minted and sent to the Producer wallet address(es).
