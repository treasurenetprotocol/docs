# Privacy Protection

## What constitutes private data in Treasurenet

In Treasurenet, we define some key information of the manufacturers in the real world as private data, such as manufacturer name, address, contact information, specific identification numbers of asset sources, and some licenses issued by the official authorities in real life, etc.

This information is essential when the manufacturers join Treasurenet because we need to verify whether the manufacturers truly possess the ability to mine, produce, or even operate assets in real life. This is very important to all users who participate or join the Treasurenet platform. If we do not review the relevant information of the manufacturers, the presence of substandard manufacturers or assets would bring no benefit to the entire platform and all users.

Once the Treasurenet platform has reviewed the information of the manufacturers and confirmed that they and their assets are genuine and safe, this information no longer has any more use for other functions in the platform. Therefore, we define this information as private data.

## Why we need to protect this privacy

Privacy matters for the security of RWAs. Although an assetâ€™s productivity is recorded live and audited to mint `$TAT`, disclosing sensitive details, such as location and physical owners, may invite unwanted complications. The decision to disclose, or not, should be made by each Producer.

The Treasurenet Foundation encourages each Producer to adhere to all regulations of its jurisdiction(s).

## How to protect private data

Simply put, audited RWAs can generate a track record of `$TAT`, but observers cannot distinguish identifying specifics of the asset.

For physical Producers of RWAs, some information is temporarily disclosed to the Foundation when physical Producers first on-board, because the Foundation needs to perform Know-Your-Business (KYB) to ensure maximum reliability for the on-chain ecosystem.

Once the KYB process is completed, this information will be deleted and any remaining information will be hashed, for Producer self-management functions. No outside observer may identify any Treasurenet linked asset, unless the Producer self-discloses.

Hereafter, only the Producer knows its own asset details after connecting. Any smart contract that audits RWAs is operating on hashed information.
