# TN Gateway and Tools

## TN Gateway

TN Gateway is an API hub for the Treasurenet blockchain, facilitating the collection, organization, storage, and transmission of data between external sources and smart contracts or dApps. It enables the seamless flow of information to and from external sources, ensuring that the blockchain ecosystem can access and utilize real-time data.

Useful for developers, TN Gateway will offer an extensive array of data, while adhering to protocol privacy parameters, such as records pertaining to dApps, staking activities, asset production data, token transaction records, and other related data. Additionally, it provides essential indexing and statistical services for effective data organization and sorting purposes.

## Data Tools

Off-chain Tools allow off-chain roles (Producers and Foundation Managers) to efficiently interact with the protocol. Tools are automated programs that can help Producers connect hardware meters to the protocol and feed other relevant asset data.

## Who can use it?

TN Gateway will soon open applications for the use of its API interface. Through simple registration and review, anyone can use it.

## What can it be used for?

TN Gateway can provide you with a one-stop solution for querying on-chain data and even data analysis. Of course, TN Gateway is continuously upgrading to provide more query information and more convenient query methods.

You can try using TN Gateway to:

- Verify the production change curve of an anonymous oil well
- Conduct research and analysis for mining
- Query transaction sizes to understand trends

## How is TN Gateway secured?

#### Encryption protection for sensitive data

We use irreversible algorithms to conceal key information, which is very necessary because not all information can be disclosed unconditionally.

#### Admission and access control

The system will control access rights according to your different uses. This will ensure the security of the information while satisfying different user needs, and also avoid attacks or extortion due to unrestricted data flow.

## Why is the data from TN Gateway trustworthy?

#### Reliable data source

Most of the data from the TN Gateway comes from the event listening module (DataProvider) of the Treasurenet blockchain network, which ensures the reliability of the data source to the maximum extent because events are only thrown when transactions are executed normally.

#### TN Gateway is open-source

You can view all the code of the TN Gateway on [github](https://github.com/treasurenetprotocol). It was originally initiated by the Treasurenet Foundation and later contributed by netizens, which leaves almost no possibility of cheating.

We welcome all developers interested in Treasurenet to contribute code for this.
