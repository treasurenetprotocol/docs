### TAT Minting Frequency

The frequency of TAT minting is limited by when government production data is updated. Producers can only mint TAT after obtaining the latest government production data and completing the production audit process. Typically, government production data is updated on a monthly basis, which means TAT minting generally follows a monthly cycle.
