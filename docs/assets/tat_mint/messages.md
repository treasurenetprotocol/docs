## What is a station letter?

The system will automatically send you a message when some key operations need your cooperation or completion; or you can send a message to the FoundationManager to ask them for any help or questions.

## Send a station letter

- Click Messages to enter the page of sending messages. Click 'Hide Read' at the top right to hide the read messages, or mark all messages as read.
