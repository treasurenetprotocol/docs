# Network Roles

Treasurenet is run by a set of distinct roles. Each one contributes to the lifecycle of work → value → liquidity.

There are three primary roles in the Treasurenet ecosystem:

* Producers – the source of real-world value   
* Validators – secure the network and validate blocks   
* Delegators – stake tokens and share in network reward

## How These Roles Work Together

| Role | Function | Rewarded With  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Producer | Generates real-world output | REP Score→ $UNIT  |
| Validator | Secures the network  | Block rewards \+ fees |
| Delegator | Supports validators with stake | Share of validator yield  |

**Detailed breakdowns for each role are provided in the subsequent technical documentation.**
