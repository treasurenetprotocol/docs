# Introduction

Treasurenet is a Layer 1 blockchain purpose-built to transform real-world activity into verified blockchain-native value.

‚ÄãIt captures physical output‚Äîsuch as **energy generation**, **resource extraction**, and **manufacturing**‚Äîand records it on-chain as verified data. This is made possible by a custom-built infrastructure designed to track, authenticate, and record physical output using smart contracts. 

At its core, **Treasurenet is a system where action generates reputation, reputation mints currency, and currency unlocks liquidity.** 

### **üîÅ How it Works**

At the core of Treasurenet‚Äôs design is a simple flow:

* **Verified work earns Rep Score**  
   Your on-chain reputation, tied directly to real-world contribution.

* **Rep Score mints UNIT**  
   A disinflationary token used for governance and protocol rewards.

* **UNIT can be collateralized to mint TCash**  
   An alternate currency used across the ecosystem for lending, payments, and other DeFi use cases.

Unlike traditional crypto models, Treasurenet **does not rely on artificial scarcity**. Value is created through proof of real work.

### **Why It Matters**

Treasurenet provides foundational infrastructure for **Real-World Assets (RWA)** and **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**.

It enables a more **transparent, equitable, and verifiable** economy‚Äîpowered by work that actually happened.

We call it: **Tokenizing Productivity.**
