# About

The Governance module is to be continuously developed with input from the community.

Currently, Treasurenet has an on-chain governance mechanism for initiating text proposals, changing chain parameters, modifying built-in contract parameters, and spending funds from the community pool.

## Community Pool

_Notice: Documentation is in progress._

TN token holders can vote to approve community pool expenditures, which can fund development and projects within the TN ecosystem.

**How is the Community Pool funded?**

1% of all tokens generated (through block rewards) are automatically transferred to and accumulated in the community pool.

**How can funding for the Community Pool change?**

Although the current funding rate is fixed at 1% per period, it can be altered through a governance proposal and is enacted immediately after the proposal passes.

**What is the balance of the Community Pool?**

Community pool account: to be updated

**How can funds from the Community Pool be spent?**

Funds can be utilized through successful governance proposals.

**How are funds disbursed after a community-spend proposal is passed?**

If a spending proposal is passed, the amount of requested funding will be transferred from the community pool to the address in the proposal.
