# Community Pool

TN token holders can vote to approve community pool expenditures, which can fund development and projects within the TN ecosystem.

## Why create a proposal to use Community Pool funds?

There are other funding options, the most famous being the "TN Grants Program". Why should you create a community pool spending proposal?

- **As a strategy: you can do both.** You can submit your proposal to the TN Grants Program, but also consider openly submitting your proposal on-chain. If the TN community votes in favor, you can withdraw your application.
- **As a strategy: funding is fast.** Apart from the time required to push your proposal on-chain, the only other limiting factor is a fixed 1-day voting period. Once the proposal passes, your account will be credited with the full amount of your proposal request.
- **Building good relations.** Publicly interacting with the community is an opportunity to build relationships with stakeholders and promote the importance of your work. Unpredictable collaborations may emerge, and the entire community may pay more attention to your work if the community gets involved as stakeholders.
- **To be more independent.** The "TN Grants Program" may not always be able to provide funds for work. Having a more consistent source of funding and reporting to stakeholders means you can be confident in your ability to secure funds through your good relations, without solely relying on the foundation.
