# Tokenomics Overview

Treasurenet's tokenomics architecture is designed to incentivize real-world productivity through a carefully structured economic framework. At the foundation of this system are three interrelated components:

* **$UNIT** – The native utility token used for securing the network, protocol governance, and rewarding validators and delegators.  
* **$TCash** – An alternate currency minted by staking $UNIT, facilitating payment and  functioning as the system’s credit money layer — akin to a digital central bank money creation window.  
* **REP Score** – A non-transferable reputation score that represents verified, productive contribution by real-world asset Producers.

Together, these mechanisms ensure that economic rewards are transparently linked to verifiable value creation.
