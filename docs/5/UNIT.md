# $UNIT – Native Utility Token

### **Role in the Network**

$UNIT is Treasurenet’s governance and utility token. Unlike cryptocurrencies backed by reserves or speculative supply caps, $UNIT derives its value directly from verified real-world output. As productive activity increases across the network, $UNIT supply expands proportionally, establishing a built-in connection between tangible value and token issuance.

### **Core Functions**

* **Staking**: Required to operate validator nodes and participate in consensus.  
* **Governance**: DAO-based governance is planned for a future release.While not yet live on-chain, Treasurenet is designed to support decentralized proposal creation and protocol-level voting.  
* **Transaction Fees**: Functions as the base currency for gas fees.  
* **Incentive Rewards**: Distributed to validators and delegators for securing the network.

### **Productivity-Based Issuance**

Whereas Bitcoin enforces a fixed halving schedule every four years, Treasurenet employs a dynamic emissions model that adjusts in response to real-world productivity:

* Block rewards are not predetermined by time.  
* Instead, they decrease proportionally based on the volume of REP Score minted during each period.

This mechanism ensures that new $UNIT tokens enter circulation only when Producers contribute measurable value—making supply a function of productivity, not scarcity.


### **Asset-Based Design Principles**

$UNIT is issued at the base layer of the Treasurenet protocol and conforms to a commodity-style issuance model:

* **Value Backed by Effort**: Every $UNIT minted corresponds to validated real-world activity. The system anchors value creation in tangible effort rather than speculative reserves.  
* **Not a Financial Security**: Due to its asset-based nature, $UNIT avoids classification as a financial security. It has no external profit guarantees or centralized reserve dependencies.  
* **Natural Supply Floor**:  The inherent economic cost of producing real-world assets enforces a baseline issuance threshold for $UNIT, ensuring that token supply growth reflects actual productive effort.
