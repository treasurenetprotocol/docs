# REP Score

### **Reputation as Proof of Work**

**REP Score** is Treasurenet’s on-chain reputation system. It provides **verifiable proof of real-world productivity**—earned through actual production, not speculative capital.

REP is **non-transferable**. Unlike tokens, it can’t be bought, sold, or delegated. It reflects what you’ve done, not what you hold.

Minted when a Producer’s output is validated via the **TN Gateway** and asset-specific modules, REP Score serves as:

* A decentralized credit score for borrowing TCash  
* A gateway to Bonus Stake and validator reward pools  
* A persistent track record of real-world contribution  
* A potential credential for governance and protocol-level access

### **How REP is Earned**

The process:
1. A Producer submits output via the TN Gateway
2. The data is validated by asset-specific modules and oracles
3. If approved, REP Score is minted to the Producer’s wallet
4. That REP becomes a public, auditable signal of productivity 


### **Each REP Score is:**

* Tied to a specific time period
* Indexed by asset class (e.g. oil, gas, compute)
* Immutable and traceable on-chain (but not personally identifiable)


### **What REP Unlocks**

| Use Case | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| Minting $UNIT | Determines how much $UNIT a Producer can generate |
| Bidding Bonus Stake | REP can be burned to qualify for higher validator rewards |
| Credit Access via $TCash | Higher REP increases borrowing capacity |
| Governance Participation | REP May be used in future DAO votes or through whitelisting |
| On-Chain Identity | REP builds a track record of productivity over time |

### **Asset-Class Specific Indexing**
Each REP score is tagged by what was produced.

This enables:
* Better credit risk profiling (e.g., oil vs. data vs. energy)
* More precise reward models
* Asset-specific governance or incentive design

For example:
* REP from solar energy may qualify you for climate-linked programs
* REP from BTC mining may be used for protocol-level coordination in compute-heavy networks.

### **Legal and Structural Design**

REP is designed to bridge on-chain proof and off-chain enforceability.
The Treasurenet DAO is exploring:

* Legal frameworks to link REP to default recovery
* Underwriting standards that rely on REP history
* Use of REP in DAO grants or treasury-based funding rounds

### **Design Principles**
| Principle | Implementation  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Non-fungible | Cannot be sold, traded, or reassigned |
| Immutable trail | Tied to verified production logs |
| Anti-gaming | Only sustained, verified output qualifies |
| Privacy-preserving | No wallet is linked to identify unless voluntarily disclosed |
| Persistent identity | REP builds over time to encourage long-term alignment  |
