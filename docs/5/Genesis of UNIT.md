# Genesis Distribution of UNIT

✅ **Total supply:** 90M $UNIT distributed with alignment to real usage, long-term participation, and minimized short-term speculation.

This distribution ensures that the people building and supporting Treasurenet—validators, developers, and early users—have a real stake in its success. Lower barriers to entry mean more room for innovation and participation from Day 0\.

3. **Protocol Reserve** (23%) \-Strategically held to fund ecosystem initiatives, liquidity programs, grants, and future community-driven proposals aligned with long term protocol growth.   
4. **Team Reserve** (10%) \- Allocated to core contributors with a clear vesting schedule, ensuring incentives are tied to long-term network success. Only unlocked tokens are eligible for staking to maintain network security.

#### **Distribution Mechanics**

* **Network Exclusivity:** UNIT tokens distributed via airdrop will initially function exclusively on the Treasurenet mainnet, with controlled bridge implementations for cross-chain liquidity.  
* **Linear Vesting:** Early producer allocations (6.75% of supply) unlock linearly over 12 months without cliffs, ensuring sustained participation through the protocol's initial growth phase.  
* **Team Alignment:** Core team tokens (10% of supply) are subject to vesting schedules with staking eligibility limited to vested tokens only, creating long-term alignment with protocol success.  
* **Founding Contributor Requirements:** Wallets receiving founding contributor allocations (20% of supply) maintain mandatory staking participation to ensure active network security contribution.
