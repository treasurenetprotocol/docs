# $TCash – Alternate Currency

### **What Is $TCash?**

$TCash is Treasurenet’s alternate digital currency—designed to support liquidity, lending, and real-world economic activity. It functions like cash within the network and enables users to borrow, transact, and settle value in a stable yet decentralized way.

### **Onboarding and Eligibility**

**Step 1: Earn REP**  
 To become eligible for borrowing $TCash, users must earn REP by verifying their real-world output on-chain. After completing two successful REP mints, users become eligible to borrow.

**Step 2: Stake UNIT**  
 Borrowers must stake $UNIT tokens as collateral. Higher REP scores boost the user’s creditworthiness, allowing access to larger TCash borrowing limits under better terms.

**Step 3 (Optional): Acquire TCash via Uniswap**

For users who don’t yet meet REP or staking requirements, $TCash is also available for purchase on Uniswap. This enables faster participation in the ecosystem — though without the credit benefits tied to REP.
