# introduction

This chapter will focus on the introduction of the Production Portal. In this section, you can learn in detail about how to add a new asset on Treasurenet, how to become a producer, how to mint TAT, and how to use the Production Portal.

## What is the Producer Portal?

The Production Portal is a system created around the assets and TAT of producers. It is a system that allows the creation of digital assets (Mint TAT) from physical assets through visual operations, aiming to help physical asset owners create TAT conveniently and quickly.

Through the Production Portal, users can convert physical assets into digital assets, and then trade or transfer them to other users, thereby achieving liquidity and value enhancement.

Treasurenet refers to users who can provide physical mining production data that meet the requirements on the Treasurenet network as [Producers](/docs/assets/basic-concepts/producer).

Producers can upload their resource production data to Treasurenet through the Producer Tool, and obtain the corresponding TAT Token priced in US dollars.

TAT Token does not directly participate in DeFi. It is a production proof that can be used for Bonus Stake to get more rewards in your PoS Stake (Refer to the [Bonus Stake section]).

## What can I do with the Production Portal?

### 1.Register as a producer

For official assets, we provide a relatively complete website for you to get started faster. https://mplatform.treasurenet.io

If you need more detailed instructions, you can refer to the [Producer Registration](/docs/producers/operation-guide/producer/registration) section.

#### Qualifications to become a producer

Firstly, different assets require different qualifications. For assets currently supported by the system, click [here](/docs/producers/assets) to view.

If you are a producer of oil or natural gas, click here to see the required qualifications.

### 2. Create a well

You need to add the mine to the system first and pass the audit before you can upload the output. Click [here](/docs/producers/operation-guide/producer/wellmanagement#2%E6%B7%BB%E5%8A%A0%E7%9F%BF%E4%BA%95%E6%B5%8B%E9%87%8F%E7%82%B9) to see the operation steps.

### 3. Upload asset output

You need to upload the real output of the asset to the system. After the output audit, TAT can be minted. Click [here](/docs/producers/operation-guide/production-data-upload) to see the operation steps.

### 4.Deposit a margin

You need to pre-deposit a certain amount of margin to ensure that when the output audit deviates, there is enough margin to prove that you did not maliciously upload the output incorrectly, and at the same time, TAT can be minted. Click [here](/docs/producers/operation-guide/producer/expense#1-%E5%AD%98%E5%85%A5%E4%BF%9D%E8%AF%81%E9%87%91) to see the operation steps.

### 5. Mint TAT

When all the above steps are completed correctly, you need to click the mint TAT button in the system, the system will conduct an output audit, if the audit passes, TAT will be successfully minted and sent to your account. Click [here](/docs/producers/operation-guide/producer/mint) to see the operation steps.

## About various calculation rules in the system

In the Production Portal, many calculations are involved, such as the conversion relationship between output and TAT, the calculation rules of output audit leading to deduction of margin, etc., all rules will be explained in the [Rules section](/docs/producers/rules).

在 Production Portal 中，涉及很多计算，例如产量和 TAT 的换算关系、产量审计导致扣除保证金的计算规则等，所有的规则将在[Rules](/docs/producers/rules)集中进行说明。
