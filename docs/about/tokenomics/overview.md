# Overview

The total supply of `$UNIT` tokens is finite, but the exact limit will vary depending on the future production of rare assets. This is because Treasurenet block rewards reduce over time. Producers work together to create RWAs to prevent `$UNIT` block rewards from decaying quickly. Whereas BTC reduces by 50% per period, `$UNIT` rewards reduce at a rate based on $`$TAT` minted, hence asset produced.
