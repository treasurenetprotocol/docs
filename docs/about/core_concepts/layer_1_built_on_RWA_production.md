# Layer 1 built on RWA Production

Treasurenet Protocol presents a novel approach, wherein the supply rate (emission) of its native protocol token is directly tied to the production rate of real-world assets, as opposed to storage. Consequently, the native protocol token captures and represents the recorded value of the real-world assets produced, creating a thriving ecosystem centered around this value.

## Two-Token System

Treasurenet operates on the basis of two tokens:

### $TAT

TAT serves as a record of real-world asset production and is rewarded to asset producers for their work.

### $UNIT

`$UNIT`, the primary token of the ecosystem, is minted by a proof-of-stake process. UNIT emission is based on the production of TAT, hence reflecting the value of real-world assets. This makes UNIT an asset-based token rather than an asset-backed one.

## DeFi WEB 3 Infrastructure

Treasurenet brings forth the novel concept of on-chain creditworthiness, asset-based collateralization, and a unique approach to asset-based tokens, instead of asset-backed tokens.

TAT can be used as a proof-of-production that a Producer has generated verifiable value. By tokenizing real-world asset productivity, Treasurenet pushes the boundary of DeFi applications with real-world assets.
