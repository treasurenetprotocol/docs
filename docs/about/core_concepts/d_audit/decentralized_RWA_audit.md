# Overview

Real-world asset production data is audited by smart contracts in the Treasurenet blockchain. By design, different asset classes call respective asset data modules, because each asset class will have unique industry processes.

Asset data modules work in tandem with the Oracle module to validate the asset production record from hardware meters by cross-referencing the production rates with publicly accessible sources, whitelisted by Treasurenetâ€™s DAO governance smart contract.

Upon successful verification of the production data, the TN protocol will allocate the corresponding quantity of `$TAT` as a reward to Producers.
