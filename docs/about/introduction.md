# Introduction

Treasurenet is a Layer 1 blockchain purpose-built to transform real-world activity into verified blockchain-native value.

​​It captures physical output—such as energy generation, resource extraction, and manufacturing—and records it on-chain as verified data. This is made possible by a custom-built infrastructure designed to track, authenticate, and record physical output using smart contracts. 

At its core, Treasurenet is a system where action generates reputation, reputation mints currency, and currency unlocks liquidity. 



🔁 # How it Works

At the core of Treasurenet’s design is a simple flow:

Verified work earns Rep Score
 Your on-chain reputation, tied directly to real-world contribution.


Rep Score mints UNIT
 A disinflationary token used for governance and protocol rewards.


UNIT can be collateralized to mint TCash
 An alternate currency used across the ecosystem for lending, payments, and other DeFi use cases.

Unlike traditional crypto models, Treasurenet does not rely on artificial scarcity. Value is created through proof of real work.

##Why It Matters

Treasurenet provides foundational infrastructure for Real-World Assets (RWA) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi).
It enables a more transparent, equitable, and verifiable economy—powered by work that actually happened.
We call it: Tokenizing Productivity.
