# Introduction

Treasurenet is a Layer 1 blockchain purpose-built to transform real-world activity into verified blockchain-native value.

​​It captures physical output—such as energy generation, resource extraction, and manufacturing—and records it on-chain as verified data. This is made possible by a custom-built infrastructure designed to track, authenticate, and record physical output using smart contracts. 

At its core, Treasurenet is a system where action generates reputation, reputation mints currency, and currency unlocks liquidity. 



## Features

&rarr; **Consensus built on Real-World Assets (RWA):** First Layer 1 blockchain built on the decentralized verification of RWA productivity, where the L1 network generates UNIT token rewards based on such RWA.

&rarr; **Scalability and Performance:** Designed for Solidity and RUST compatibility and low latency, Treasurenet ensures efficient handling of real-world assets on its blockchain, paving the way for broader adoption of decentralized asset management.

&rarr; **RWA for UNIT Token Emission:** Treasurenet's protocol token, UNIT, has a finite and disinflationary supply. Block rewards emission rate is determined by RWA production rate.

&rarr; **RWA for Bonus Block Rewards:** Treasurenet employs a unique validator selection process, where validator nodes are rewarded based not only on contributions to the network but also on real-world asset production.

&rarr; **Decentralized Governance:** Treasurenet's DAO plays a crucial role in governing the platform, making decisions about key protocol parameters and interacting with the community via non-profit foundation.
