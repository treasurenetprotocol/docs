# Delegators

**Participate in Network Security Without Running a Node**

Not everyone wants to run a validator. But everyone holding UNIT can still participate.

Delegators play a critical role in Treasurenet’s consensus by staking their UNIT tokens with active validators. In return, they earn a portion of the validator’s rewards—while helping keep the network decentralized and secure.

**What is a Delegator?**

A Delegator is any UNIT holder who chooses to support the network by assigning their stake to an existing validator, rather than running a node themselves.

This process is known as **delegated staking**.

**Why Delegate?**

Delegation is designed for:

* Users who don’t have the hardware, time, or technical knowledge to run a validator
* Passive participants who want to earn yield from staking
* Ecosystem contributors who want to back trustworthy validators 

It offers:

* Yield from staking rewards
* No need to maintain infrastructure
* The ability to support validators who align with your values
