# How to Choose a Validator

Key criteria:

* Uptime and block validation rate
* Commission fees and reward history
* Transparency (e.g., published website, governance votes)
* Track record of REP Score and productivity (if participating in Bonus Stake) 

Well-managed validators not only maximize your rewards—they help secure the future of Treasurenet.

**Can I Undelegate or Switch?**

Yes — Treasurenet gives Delegators flexibility in managing their staked $UNIT:

* Unbond: Withdraw your tokens after a set unbonding period.
* Re-delegate: Instantly switch your stake to a different validator (if the protocol allows).
* Split Stake: Spread your delegation across multiple validators to diversify your position.
