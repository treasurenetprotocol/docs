# How Delegation Works

1. Choose a validator from the active set
2. Delegate your UNIT tokens using a supported wallet or staking portal
3. Your tokens are bonded to that validator and begin earning a share of rewards
4. You can re-delegate, unbond, or switch validators at any time (subject to lockup periods) 

The validator may deduct a small commission to cover operating costs. The remainder of the rewards are distributed to you proportionally based on your stake.
