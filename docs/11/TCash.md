# TCash — Alternate Currency for the Productive Economy

### **The Role of TCash in Treasurenet**

It is Treasurenet’s native **credit-based currency**, designed to move productivity—not just capital.

Where traditional money relies on central authority and fiat collateral, TCash is minted against **real-world output** and governed by transparent on-chain reputation (REP) and UNIT collateral.

### **Core Utilities**

#### **🧾 1\. Medium of Exchange (MoE)**

TCash serves as the **primary currency** within the Treasurenet ecosystem:

* Used for transactions between participants  
* Accepted for funding and repayment in Otter streams  
* Redeemable via on-chain swaps or stablecoin bridges

#### **💰 2\. Unit of Account (UoA)**

* TCash-denominated pricing anchors value to **productive output**, not volatile speculation  
  Stream contracts, repayments, and reserve calculations are all expressed in TCash

#### **🏦 3\. Store of Credit Value (SoCV)**

Unlike fiat currencies that inflate through arbitrary issuance, TCash is:

* Minted based on earned REP and collateralized UNIT  
* Limited by system-wide production and credit conditions  
* Governed by DAO-reviewed monetary policy (Prime Rate)
