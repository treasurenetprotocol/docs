# Otter — Decentralized Capital Markets Layer

### **What is Otter?**

**Otter** is Treasurenet’s native capital formation engine—  
 a decentralized protocol that lets users **invest directly in real-world productivity.**

It replaces banks and middlemen with on-chain reputation, allowing **producers to raise capital** and **contributors to earn yield**—all based on verified work.

### **How It Works**

###  **1\. Producers Raise Capital**

Producers with a verifiable Rep Score can initiate fundraising campaigns:

* **Debt Streams**: Fixed repayments over 12 months

* **Cashflow Streams**: Sell a share of future REP earnings

* **Hybrid Instruments** *(coming soon)*: Equity-style structures with upside exposure. Each fundraising stream is tied to their on-chain production performance.

####  **2\. Contributors Fund via TCash**

Holders of TCash can:

* Browse available streams

* Assess Rep Score and production metrics

* Choose “rafts” (tranches of a stream) to invest into

No off-chain approvals, no intermediaries.  
 Only verifiable work, reputation, and trustless capital flows.

####  **3\. Repayment or Royalties**

Once a raft is filled:

* Producer withdraws TCash to fund their project

* Contributor receives monthly repayments or revenue share

* All payments are automated and auditable
