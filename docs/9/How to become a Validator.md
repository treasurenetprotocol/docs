# How to become a Validator

To activate a validator node, you’ll need both technical setup and a financial stake.

**Minimum Stake**

* 158 UNIT tokens are required to become a validator.

**Hardware Requirements**

* CPU: 4 or more physical cores  
* RAM: Minimum 16GB  
* Storage: 500GB SSD or greater  
* Network: At least 100 Mbps stable connection  
* OS: Linux/x86\_64 preferred (macOS and Windows support is in progress)

Treasurenet nodes must be scalable—future block history and usage will increase system demands.

**Software Setup**

* Install validator node software from Treasurenet’s GitHub  
* Generate and secure validator keys  
* Sync with the current blockchain state  
* Join the active validator set by meeting staking and setup requirements

**Visibility and Delegation**

Validators are ranked by performance and trust.

To attract more delegation:

* Publish your validator identity, uptime, and commission structure
* Build a website or dashboard
* Be transparent with your governance participation
* Engage with the Treasurenet community and DAO

Your validator reputation—on-chain and off—is a key differentiator.
