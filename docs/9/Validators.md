# Validators

**Securing the Network, One Block at a Time**

Validators are critical to Treasurenet’s infrastructure. They run full nodes, validate blocks, and maintain network consensus—while putting capital on the line.

In return, they earn rewards for securing the protocol and helping it scale.

### **What Does a Validator Do?**

Validators perform three essential roles:

1. Propose new blocks  
2. Verify and vote on blocks created by peers  
3. Maintain network consensus through Tendermint BFT

They are also responsible for:

* Ensuring high uptime  
* Preventing double-signing  
* Participating in protocol governance  
* Sharing rewards with their delegators

Validators keep the network decentralized, accountable, and verifiable.

**Validator Rewards**

Validators are compensated through:

* Block rewards paid in UNIT
* Transaction fees from each block they validate
* Optional commission on delegator rewards
* Bonus incentives for Super Validators (see below)

Performance matters: validators with better uptime and lower commission often attract more delegation.

**Penalties and Slashing**

The network enforces penalties to ensure validator integrity.

Misbehavior includes:

* Going offline or missing blocks
* Double-signing transactions
* Failing to participate in consensus rounds 

**Consequences:**

* Partial slashing of the validator’s staked UNIT
* Removal from the active validator set for severe violations
* Reputational loss, which may reduce future delegation 

The higher the rewards, the higher the responsibility.

**Super Validators**

Super Validators earn elevated rewards by:

* Staking UNIT
* Burning REP Score to compete for inclusion 

Super Validators receive both base and bonus block rewards. Approximately 30% of all protocol emissions are reserved for this pool over time.

This creates a productivity-linked competition—only the most reputable contributors can earn more.
