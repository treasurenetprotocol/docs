# Wallet Setup: MetaMask & Coinbase Wallet

To interact with the Treasurenet blockchain—view assets, mint tokens, or access dApps—you'll need a browser-based wallet. Treasurenet currently supports MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet.

## 1. Installing a Wallet Extension

Choose one of the following wallet extensions and install it on a Chromium-based browser (Chrome recommended):

### MetaMask

* Visit [metamask.io](https://metamask.io/)
* Click Download > Install MetaMask for Chrome
* Approve installation prompts
* A fox icon will appear in your browser toolbar

### Coinbase Wallet

<VideoPlayer src="/img/video/DownloadCoinbase.mp4" title="Video Tutorial: How to Download Coinbase Wallet" />

* Visit the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/)
* Search for Coinbase Wallet
* Click Add to Chrome
* A blue circle icon will appear in your browser toolbar

## 2. Connecting to Treasurenet

You can connect your wallet in two ways:

### Automatic Setup (Recommended)

The easiest way is through [Treasurenet's official website](https://wallet.treasurenet.io), which will detect your wallet and walk you through connection and account creation.

### Manual Setup

To manually add Treasurenet networks:

* Network Name: Treasurenet Mainnet Alpha
* RPC URL: https://rpc.treasurenet.io
* Chain ID: 5570
* Currency Symbol: UNIT
* Block Explorer URL: https://scan.treasurenet.io/

#### Testnet (Development)

* Network Name: Treasurenet Testnet
* RPC URL: https://wallet.testnet.treasurenet.io
* Chain ID: 5005
* Currency Symbol: UNIT

Once added, select the desired network to activate it.

## 3. Importing an Existing Account (MetaMask Only)

If you're using MetaMask and want to import an existing wallet:

1. Click the MetaMask icon
2. Go to your avatar > Import Account
3. Paste your private key
4. Click Import

Your account will now be visible in the wallet.

## 4. Importing Treasurenet Tokens

To display $REP in your wallet:

### MetaMask

* Open MetaMask > Import Tokens
* Paste the contract address: $REP: 0x465C5ed965692F850f0a3Df1aA29955953a53714

### Coinbase Wallet

* Go to Settings > Hidden Assets
* Click the + icon
* Paste the same contract address

Once added, the $REP token will appear in your wallet's asset list.

After completing these steps, your wallet is connected to Treasurenet. You're now ready to participate in the ecosystem—whether you're holding tokens, or staking.
