# Why Privacy Matters

Even though production data is verified to mint REP Score, revealing operational details could create risks:

* 🎯 Security threats (e.g., targeted attacks on physical sites)
* 🌐 Jurisdictional risk (varying regulations across countries)
* 🕵️‍♀️ Front-running or market manipulation (in open RWA markets) 

That’s why Treasurenet leaves disclosure entirely in the hands of the Producer. You choose what to share—if anything.

### **How Treasurenet Protects Private Data**

During onboarding, select details are **temporarily shared** with the Treasurenet Foundation for KYB review.

**After verification:**

* Personally identifiable info is **deleted**  
* Any remaining metadata is **hashed and stored off-chain**  
* Producers retain access for their own dashboards or analytics

On-chain audits operate **only on hashed data**—no public observer or smart contract can trace a REP score back to a specific identity or location.

In short: **REP Score can prove productivity without revealing who, where, or how.**

### **Compliance Note**

While Treasurenet ensures privacy within its ecosystem, the Foundation encourages all Producers to comply with applicable laws and regulations in their jurisdictions.
