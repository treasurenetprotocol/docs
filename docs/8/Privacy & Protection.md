# Privacy & Protection

#### **Verifying Work Without Exposing Identity**

Treasurenet is designed to validate real-world production without compromising sensitive personal or operational data.

This section breaks down:

* What counts as private data
* Why it matters
* How Treasurenet protects it 

### **What Counts as Private Data?**

During onboarding, some producers may share real-world identifiers to prove they operate legitimate infrastructure.

This may include:

* Legal entity name & registration
* Asset location or license numbers
* Contact or ownership information 

This is part of a Know-Your-Business (KYB) process, used only onceâ€”to ensure the producer is qualified to submit data.

After onboarding, this information is never stored on-chain or reused.
