# New Asset Registration

Treasurenet welcomes any valuable assets to join us and generate corresponding TAT Tokens.

To ensure a relative balance with existing assets, we agree that the minted TAT needs to meet a value target of 1TAT=1US dollar. As long as this value anchor is met, you can add any assets to the Treasurenet project.

So how do you bring new assets into Treasurenet?

Firstly, you need to draft contracts (group of contracts) for the new assets. These primarily comprise two parts:

- Producer Information Processing Contract (Producer Contract) ->Contract Writing Instructions
- Production Data Processing and Storage Contract (Production Data Contract) ->Contract Writing Instructions

Next, you need to modify the existing Oracle module github for the new asset, providing the contract system with verification data from a trustworthy data source. After making the changes, you need to contact the staff on github to add it as a new branch to the code library.

Thirdly, you need to provide a complete tool or a method for producers to use, allowing other producers who own the same type of assets as you to join more easily.

Then, you can come to our service platform to propose the addition of new resources.

To allow everyone to better understand the new resource you wish to add in your proposal, you need to include at least the following content in the proposal:

1. Name, description
2. Business logic, introduction of resource value (i.e., prove why this resource is valuable)
3. New contract github source code address and detailed description of contract logic
4. Security proof of the new contract (such as passing an audit)
5. New branch of Oracle's module and related explanations (need to explain why the verification data of the new resource is trustworthy and effective)
6. Producer tools (or methods for adding resources) and detailed instructions
7. Contact information, social ways for feedback, and communication

We strongly suggest you provide as much additional information as possible to let more people know about you and the assets you want to add. This will greatly help the proposal pass the governance vote as soon as possible.

After your proposal is approved, the Treasurenet Foundation will get in touch with you and cooperate with you to complete the subsequent operations.

In addition, we also recommend that you provide a website with convenient features, which will be beneficial for producers' daily operations, including providing data, queries, historical information, etc. Not all producers possess certain technical capabilities. Website data can be obtained through event listening and query operations. More content can be queried through API.

**Of course, if you don't have sufficient development capabilities but still wish to join us, you can consider achieving this through the Dapp incubation program. For more information on the Dapp incubation program, click here for more information.**
