# Introduction

Treasurenet Protocol is the first Layer 1 blockchain protocol that is creating an on-chain economic system, based on real-world rare assets.

The core objective is to achieve complete integration between the digital and physical economies by introducing a hybrid medium of stored value called the **$UNIT** token. Through this, we aim to establish a unified WEB3 financial system that seamlessly combines the strengths of both digital and physical assets.

## Features

&rarr; **Consensus built on Real-World Assets (RWA):** First Layer 1 blockchain built on the decentralized verification of RWA productivity, where the L1 network generates UNIT token rewards based on such RWA.

&rarr; **Scalability and Performance:** Designed for Solidity and RUST compatibility and low latency, Treasurenet ensures efficient handling of real-world assets on its blockchain, paving the way for broader adoption of decentralized asset management.

&rarr; **RWA for UNIT Token Emission:** Treasurenet's protocol token, UNIT, has a finite and deflationary supply. Block rewards emission rate is determined by RWA production rate.

&rarr; **RWA for Bonus Block Rewards:** Treasurenet employs a unique validator selection process, where validator nodes are rewarded based not only on contributions to the network but also on real-world asset production.

&rarr; **Decentralized Governance:** Treasurenet's DAO plays a crucial role in governing the platform, making decisions about key protocol parameters and interacting with the community via non-profit foundation.
