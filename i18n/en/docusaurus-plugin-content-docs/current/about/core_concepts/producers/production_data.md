# Production Data

Production Data refers to the output of physical or digital assets provided by the Producer.

1. Producer provides the real output of assets
2. Treasurenet obtains the public market price of assets produced
3. Treasurenet modules conduct decentralized output auditing

After passing the audit, `$TAT` will be minted corresponding to the value of assets produced.

## How to be a Producer

Treasurenet is building and is working towards a standardized process for various assets to connect to obtain anonymously audited records of RWA production.

In the meantime, please connect with Treasurenet Foundation at contact@treasurenet.org for RWA onboarding.

## Pilot Producers

### Physical assets: Natural Gas & Oil

Natural gas and oil are the initial choices for introducing the TN concept: rare assets to determine currency supply. These assets can be monitored consistently and objectively using on-site hardware in enclosed environments.

### Digital assets: BTC & ETH Classic

Bitcoin and established networks embody the concept of rare assets, digitally. TN Gateway connects to the BTC network, so producing rare digital assets would also drive the Treasurenet currency supply.
