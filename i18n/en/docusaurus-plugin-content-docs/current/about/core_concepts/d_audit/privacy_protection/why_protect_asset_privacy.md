# Why we need to protect this privacy

Privacy matters for the security of RWAs. Although an assetâ€™s productivity is recorded live and audited to mint `$TAT`, disclosing sensitive details, such as location and physical owners, may invite unwanted complications. The decision to disclose, or not, should be made by each Producer.

The Treasurenet Foundation encourages each Producer to adhere to all regulations of its jurisdiction(s).
