# How to protect private data

Simply put, audited RWAs can generate a track record of `$TAT`, but observers cannot distinguish identifying specifics of the asset.

For physical Producers of RWAs, some information is temporarily disclosed to the Foundation when physical Producers first on-board, because the Foundation needs to perform Know-Your-Business (KYB) to ensure maximum reliability for the on-chain ecosystem.

Once the KYB process is completed, this information will be deleted and any remaining information will be hashed, for Producer self-management functions. No outside observer may identify any Treasurenet linked asset, unless the Producer self-discloses.

Hereafter, only the Producer knows its own asset details after connecting. Any smart contract that audits RWAs is operating on hashed information.
