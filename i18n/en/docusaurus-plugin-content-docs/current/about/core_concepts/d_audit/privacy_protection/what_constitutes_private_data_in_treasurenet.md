# What constitutes private data in Treasurenet

In Treasurenet, we define some key information of the manufacturers in the real world as private data, such as manufacturer name, address, contact information, specific identification numbers of asset sources, and some licenses issued by the official authorities in real life, etc.

This information is essential when the manufacturers join Treasurenet because we need to verify whether the manufacturers truly possess the ability to mine, produce, or even operate assets in real life. This is very important to all users who participate or join the Treasurenet platform. If we do not review the relevant information of the manufacturers, the presence of substandard manufacturers or assets would bring no benefit to the entire platform and all users.

Once the Treasurenet platform has reviewed the information of the manufacturers and confirmed that they and their assets are genuine and safe, this information no longer has any more use for other functions in the platform. Therefore, we define this information as private data.
