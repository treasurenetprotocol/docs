# What is Bonus Stake

Treasurenet introduces the concept of Bonus Stake based on real-world asset production. Not only can users stake `$UNIT` tokens into Validator nodes, users can bid `$TAT` tokens for a chance at bonus stake rewards.

While `$UNIT` tokens that are staked are never lost, `$TAT` tokens that are casted for bids will be burned. This is the cost for unlocking maximum `$UNIT` token rewards.
