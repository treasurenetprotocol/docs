# What is Staking

Treasurenet blockchain network is kept online by independent computing nodes, also called Validator nodes, that work together to securely record network events. In return, the network rewards currency in the form of `$UNIT` tokens to these nodes.

To keep every node in check, nodes must deposit, or stake, `$UNIT` tokens that are to be penalized if any node acts against the rules of the network, for example to keep record of RWA productivity. Every node is vigilant of each other, and maintains the Treasurenet distributed ledger.

To further encourage decentralized participation, Validator nodes must accept deposits, or stake, from any token holder. Therefore, users may participate in securing the network and earning rewards without needing to operate hardware.
