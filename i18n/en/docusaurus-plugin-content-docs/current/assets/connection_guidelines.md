# Connection Guidelines

To maximize reliability of Treasurenet's real-world asset ecosystem, physical Producers that operate off-chain are required to temporarily disclose some operating information for screening.

It is important to note, physical Producers would have hardware requirements to install 3rd party measuring devices for recording asset production.

Digital asset Producers have native on-chain records and are exempt from screening.

## General Steps for physical Producers

### Initial KYB and KYC

Producers log into the Production Portal, first go through KYB (business verification), and then KYC (personal verification). KYC can only be initiated after KYB has been passed. Both KYB and KYC are verified by an external data service provider.

### Initial and periodic asset review

Initial review criteria is set according to the workflow of each specific asset class.
Treasurenet Foundation Manager will review the submissions according to applicable asset workflows.

Periodic review is usually every 1 year. If the periodic review is not completed, the affected assets will not be able to mint $TAT. Producers will receive a prompt in the Production Portal when applicable to submit updated documentations.
